-- Case 2:  What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value?

We have to find the count of customers by month(group by) for trail plan = 'trail'
Firstly, count the customers based on trail plan, 
then extract the month name and number and group by months.

SELECT
    COUNT(s.customer_id) as Total_customers, 
    DATE_PART('MONTH', s.start_date) as months,
    TO_CHAR(s.start_date, 'MONTH')
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p
	ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE s.plan_id = 0
 GROUP BY    DATE_PART('MONTH', s.start_date),
     TO_CHAR(s.start_date, 'MONTH')
 ORDER BY months;
 
 Functions used:
 DATE_PART to extract numerical value from the start date column
 **DATE_PART( 'field value', date_time column ) function is used to query for subfields from a date or time value
 
 TO_CHAR to cast numerical value to characters TO_CHAR(column/expression, numeric/date value)
 **TO_CHAR function is used to typecast a numeric or date input to character type
